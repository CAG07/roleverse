### Campaign Overview

After creating a campaign, you'll see its overview page with:

- Campaign name, description, and game system details.

## Troubleshooting

### "Sign in with Google" doesn't work

- Make sure you're using a supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari).
- Check that pop-ups are not blocked — the Google sign-in window may be prevented from opening.
- Try clearing your browser cache or using a private/incognito window.

### I signed in but got sent back to the landing page

- Try signing in again. Your session may have expired.
- If the issue persists, clear your browser cookies for the RoleVerse site and try again.

### I see an "Unauthorized" page after signing in

- Access may be restricted to specific accounts. Contact the RoleVerse administrator to have your Google email added to the allowed list.

### The page won't load or looks broken

- Make sure your browser is up to date.
- Try a hard refresh: **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+Shift+R** (macOS).
- If the problem continues, [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/CAG07/roleverse/issues).
